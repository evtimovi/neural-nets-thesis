# neural-nets-thesis
This is a repository for the code work to be performed as part of a senior thesis at Lafayette College under the supervision of Professor Amir Sadovnik.

The folder basic contains implementations of the neural network that will be trained to recognize digits from the MNIST data set. These follow the TensorFlow tutorials [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/tutorials/mnist/beginners/index.html) and [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/tutorials/mnist/pros/index.html#deep-mnist-for-experts).
